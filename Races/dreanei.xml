			<p><i>In moments of great strife, I gaze into the heavens and see just how far we have already come.</i></p>
			<p align="right"><i>â€” Prophet Velen </i></p>
			<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
			<p class="indent">Thousands of years ago, the titan Sargeras shattered the tranquility of Argus by offering the eredar immeasurable knowledge and power. The eredar were a knowledge-seeking race and accepted his offer. He bathed them in his fel might, turning them into demonic beings of the burning legion called Man'ari. The prophet Velen got a troubling vision of what his race would become, and fled Argus with his followers by the help of the divine Naaru, who renamed them draenei, or "Exiled Ones" in the common tongue.</p>
			<p class="indent">The draenei refer to their corrupted brethren as man'ari, meaning "Unnatural Being". Although both originate from the eredar race, neither the draenei or man'ari consider themselves eredars anymore.</p>
			<h3>ALIEN APPEARANCE</h3>
			<p>While they stand tall and proud, they resemble no other race on Azeroth. Their skin ranges from rose white, to dark violet colors. They stand slightly taller than humans on average, ranging from well over 6 feet tall to just over 8 feet. They are generally more muscular than other races, with double jointed legs ending in hooves, weighing 250 pounds or more. Males and females are about the same height, and male are only marginally heavier than females.</p>
			<p class="indent">Both genders have tendrils in their head as part of their hair or beard, and both have horns, it is common though for females to have drastically larger horns than males. They also have slender tails, males being considerably longer and thicker than females.</p>
			<p class="indent">Broken draenei, although having many of their pure kins features have noticeable differences, their faces are less structured, and appear more flat than their kins beautiful features. They stand shorter than exodar draenei, their skin hard and cracked like stone, appearing more human than exodar draenei with single jointed legs.</p>
			<h3>THE DIVINE NARU</h3>
			<p>During the draenei's journey, the enigmatic naaru race taught them the ways of the light, though they already had a certain experience with it through Velen and T'uure. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the Burning Legion.</p>
			<p class="indent">The naaru bestowed a blessing, the Gift of the Naaru, upon the draenei to signify their new connection the light. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the it and uphold the naaru's ideals.</p>
			<h3>AFFILIATION</h3>
			<p>Due to the draenei's friendly and honorable attitude, they tend to get along well with other races, especially those who belong to the Alliance who welcomed them into their allegiance, even though not all races return their kindness. Draenei have very strong ties with the night elves, who were the first of the Alliance to greet the draenei and welcome them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Draenei hate orcs for the kins actions on Draenor, leading to a large distrust from the draenei side of the horde and its allied races.</p>
			<h3>NAMES</h3>
			<p>Draenei, unlike most races, do not have last names. Their parents give them a name at their birth. Upon a draenei reaching adulthood they choose a name for themselves that they keep for the rest of their life.</p>
			<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Meolphi, Bimerd, Hiktin, Ocdam, Nosmas, Ondut, Broruk, Oter, Lacasik, Midirgerd, Drocran</p>
      <p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Eshaatt, Ize, Ruka, Nalre, Hahse, Efae, Nerii, Asara, Velbus, Fuma, Oren, Suhe, Vumo</p>
			<h3>DRAENEI TRAITS</h3>
			<p>Draenei share certain racial traits given to them upon their renewal by the naaru.</p>

			<p><strong><i>Age.</i></strong> Draenei mature slightly slower than humans, reaching adulthood in their early 20's, and can live to extraordinary age, become thousands of years old, often exceeding the ancient ages of night elves.</p>
			<p><strong><i>Alignment.</i></strong> Draenei are mostly good. Those who strive towards law are sages, priests, paladins, vindicators, or scholars. Those who tend toward chaos are warriors, rangers, or in other ways people more fond of pure fighting.</p>
			<p><strong><i>Size.</i></strong> Draenei are between 7 and 8 feet tall and somewhat muscular. Your size is Medium.</p>
