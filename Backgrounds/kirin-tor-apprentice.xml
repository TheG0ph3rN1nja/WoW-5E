You've spent enough time within Kirin Tors libraries, learning what knowledge interested you, and have been sent out onto Azeroth by your mentor to seek know-ledge elsewhere, and to gain experience.</p>

			<h4>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
			<p>An apprentice of the Kirin Tor is often eager to learn what lies around Azeroth, wishing to learn any knowledge given to them.

			<p>You know at least one prominent mage within the Kirin Tor that you can call upon for answers and information. You've learnt a simple but limited spell that makes you able to contact them as long as you are on the same plane of existence. The spell is limited to a 100 word message, and a 100 word reply from the mentor. Once you've contacted your mentor, you cannot contact him again for a week, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher.</p>
			<p class="indent">At the DMs discretion, the mentors information may be false, missing vital details, or they may not respond within a timely fashion.</p>
			<p class="indent">Discuss the details of the mages you know within the Kirin Tor with your DM.</p>
