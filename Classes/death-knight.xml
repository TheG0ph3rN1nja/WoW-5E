			<p><i>A hero... that's what you once were. You stood against the shadow, and purchased another dawn for this world at the cost of your life. But the evil you fought is not so easily banished, the victory you claimed not so easily held. The specter of death looms over this world again, it has found new champions to bring about its final reign. Knights of darkness, this is the hour of your dark rebirth...</i></p>
			<p align="right"><i>— A knight of the Ebon Blade</i></p>
			<p class="indent">A human clad in heavy armor, wielding a greatsword with both hands, as he clutches it close, runes flash along its edge, leaving a stream of black smoke behind his swings.</p>
			<p class="indent">An orc surrounded by kobolds, forces his axe into the ground as the earth around him wither and die, frightening the kobolds as they run for their life.</p>
			<p class="indent">Biting cold rushes through the battle, as a lone blood elf walks forward, her armor clad in a layer of frost, she walks with firm steps, freezing the earth beneath her feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">No matter their past calling, death knights serve the powers of death, wielding weapons infused with runes of power. They are ruthless and practical warriors resurrected by the powerful val'kyrs and granted the powers of the revered death knights of the Ebon Hold. Although these warriors seem dead at a glance, they are very much alive.</p>
			<h3>OUTCAST FOR LIFE</h3>
			<p>Although these death knights are not undead as the genera-tions before them, they carry much of the essence of the knights that came before them, and from a distance have the look of a dead person, their blank white stares peering at the world around them. Even though they are alive and not emotionless, it means little to most they meet who shun them because of what they have become. Death knights are bringers of death and destroy, a fact not easily forgotten.</p>
			<p class="indent">This has lead most death knights down a solitary path, many keep to the outskirts of towns and cities, or hide their appearance well before entering.</p>
			<h3>GRIM REVIVAL</h3>
			<p>Being resurrected as a death knight is not a simple task, only complicated further by the scar it leaves on the newly resurrected, gaining the powers of the death knights weak-ens the soul for a tremendous time, a price that has to be paid. But not only does it drain the death knight, some scars are visible for all to see, their resurrection has filled their body with necrotic energy that will forever linger with-in them, a trait always shown through their eyes, which will forever sit as two white lights in their sockets.</p>
			<h3>STEADFAST WARRIORS</h3>
			<p>Death knights are exceptional warriors, and in many ways similar to paladins, being keen with various weapons and able to fight in any armor, aiding their combat with the use of magic. They wield their empowered runic weapons and shadow magic which enables them to overpower most foes that would dare to stand against them, making them fearful fighters able to stand in any situation.</p>

			<h3>BECOMING A DEATH KNIGHT</h3>
			<p>For most, becoming a death knight was not a choice, the vast majority of death knights was raised by the Lich King and enslaved under his control, very few remain of the death knights that was freed from his control. Because of this very few new death knights are made, as death knights does not wish to give other their fates, living a live without feelings, in constant battle against the Lich King's ever present control. Necromancers cared little for what death knights wanted, and in secret studied incantations and rituals that would make them able to gain the powers of the revered death knights. Eventually they succeed and crafted a dark simulacrum, detailing complex spells that would allow them to gain the powers of a death knight, without the sacrifice of death, and outside the Lich King's control. To this day their efforts has been eliminated and their simulacrum lost to time.</p>
			<p class="indent">As you choose to use the simulacrum to become a death knight, consider why you decided to undergo the transfor-mation. Did you seek greater power that what was offered in the living world? Were you seeking a means to end the scourge? Perhaps you were simply curious as to the tomes spells and did not know what you were entering? Perhaps you were sick of your previous life, and wished for a new beginning?</p>
			<p class="indent">Think about what effect the transformation has done to you, becoming a death knight comes at a cost, it splits a fragment of your soul, forever changing part of you, while these death knights are still alive, the resurrection often changes how one acts, if not for the memory of having sacrificed yourself, then the necrotic energy now rushing through your body.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Your dark resurrection has filled you with necrotic energies that make you able to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for for the death knight spell list.</p>
			<h4>SPELL SLOTS</h4>
			<p>The Death knight table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your death knight spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example. when you are 5th level, you have three 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell cause fear, you must spend one of those slots, casting it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
			<h4>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h4>
			<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the death knight spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Death Knight table shows when you learn more death knight spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. For example, when you reach 5th level, you learn a new death knight spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the death knight spells you know and replace it with another spell from the death knight spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h4>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h4>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your death knight spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, when you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cast death knight spell and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
        <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
        <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
