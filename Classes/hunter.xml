      <p><i>The way of the hunter is one of mastery over the beasts of the world, an unparalleled precision in marksmanship, and the knowledge of how to survive in situations where others would perish.</i></p>
      <p align="right"><i>— Ranger Sallina</i></p>
      <br />
      <p class="indent">Wild and barbaric looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a spear in his hands, he charges in with intense fury, a large bear running at his side, roaring as he engages, cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
      <p class="indent">Tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, a night elf finds her feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the blue dragon. Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps between the dragon's thick scales.</p>
      <p class="indent">Holding his hand high, a blood elf whistles to the hawk that circles high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering instructions in Thalassian, he points to the owlbear he's been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
      <h3>INESCAPABLE STALKERS</h3>
      <p>From an early age the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become hunters. As masters of their environment, hunters are able to slip like ghosts through the trees and lay traps in the paths of their enemies. These expert marksman drop foes dead in their tracks with flawless shots from a bow, crossbow or rifle. With the ability to wield two weapons simultaneously, hunters can unleash a flurry of blows against anyone unfortunate enough to stumble into close combat with them.</p>
      <p class="indent">The art of survival is central to the isolated life of a hunter. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Hunters are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.</p>
      <h3>PROUD RANGERS</h3>
      <p>The hunter is a stalker in the wilds, living on his knowledge of survival and skill with a bow or rifle. He is deeply in tune with nature, and some of its mightiest beasts are his allies.</p>
      <p class="indent">Of Azeroth's many creatures, few can resist the hunter's call, and fewer can survive his fury. Hunters are as varied as the world's many climates, but they are universally renowned for their amazing abilities to find their prey and bring it down. Most hunters seek to aid the balance of nature along with their druidic allies. Elven rangers are not alone in their mastery of the wilderness. While an elven ranger prefers the bow, the hunter would rather get up close. A hunter is skilled in stealth, slipping through the woods like a ghost.</p>
      <h3>THE HUNTERS CHOICE</h3>
      <p>The hunter is the choice of life for those who reject societies that oppress the natural role as prey and hunter, and also reject the druidic stance that we should be healers and observers rather than active participants in the "Great Hunt".</p>
      <p class="indent">They follow a life of reverence for nature complimenting their tradition and willingness to use man-made tools. We are all tool-using creatures after all, and it is only natural to use that advantage afforded by nature to be better hunters. There are however also those hunters who prefer a more direct approach to tracking and hunting.</p>

      <h3>CREATING A HUNTER</h3>
      <p>As you create your hunter character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the hunter's ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship. or was your mentor slain, perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of hunters affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
      <p class="indent">Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?</p>

    <description>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you learn to enter a heightened state of focus in combat. Your access to this focus is represented by a number of focus points. Your hunter level determines the number of focus points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Hunter table.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend these points to perform various focus fea-tures. Each focused attack must be declared before making an attack, unless otherwise specified. You can only use one focused attack per attack roll.</p>
			<p class="indent">You learn two focused attacks of your choice when you gain this feature, which are detailed under Focused Attacks below. You learn an additional focused attack of your choice at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. When you learn a new focused attack, you can also replace one focused attack you know with another from the list.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you spend a focus point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which your focus is regained. Additionally you regain 1 expended focus point each time you roll a 20 on the d20 roll for an attack with a weapon, or deal the killing blow to a creature of significant threat (DM's discretion).</p>
			<p class="indent">Some of your focused attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attacks effect. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Focus Save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
