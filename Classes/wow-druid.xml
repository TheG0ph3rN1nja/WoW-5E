      <p class="indent">Clutching an engraved staff stitched with leaves, a night elf summons the powers of elune, calling down raw blue energy of the moon upon a terrible foe, smashing upon its body and encasing it hole for a brief moment.</p>
      <p class="indent">Crouching out of sight on a low hanging tree branch, in the form of a large feral tiger, a worgen scouts out from his hiding stop towards the constructions of Zul'Gurub. Watching every move of the jungle trolls patrolling.</p>
      <p claas="indent">Holding near her sickle and staff, a young tauren druid is making beautiful ritual, making tiny seeds sprinkle into a perfect circle of faintly glowing green lights, healing an endured ally to the best of her capabilities.</p>
      <p class="indent">Rushing forward towards his companions aid, rumbling the ground as his body transforms into a giant bear creature with tusks, an experienced troll runs to his allies aid, blocking a fatal blow with its fur.</p>
      <h3>NATURE"S POWER</h3>
      <p>Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature’s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies.</p>
      <p class="indent">They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, creatures of water, and creatures of air with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment’s notice.</p>

      <h3>PROTECTORS OF BALANCE</h3>
      <p>Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline.</p>
      <p class="indent">It’s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.</p>
      <p class="indent">Druids harness nature’s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature’s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.</p>
      <h3>CREATING A DRUID</h3>
      <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience.</p>
      <h4>QUICK BUILD</h4>
      <p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. (Some druids focus more on their physical traits than their mental ones, preferring Dexterity for Feral, and Strength for Guardian over Wisdom.)</p>
      <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
      <p>As a druid, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h4>HIT POINTS</h4>
      <ul class="unstyled">

				<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>PROFICIENCIES</h4>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
        <li><strong>Armor:</strong> Light armor, medium armor</li>
				<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple Weapons</li>

    <description>
      <p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 6 of this book for the druid spell list.</p>
      <h4>CANTRIPS</h4>
      <p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>
      <h4>PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS</h4>
      <p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast a druid spell, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You re-gain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
      <p class="indent">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
      <p class="indent">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
      <p class="indent">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
      <h4>SPELLCATING ABILITY</h4>
      <p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attune-ment to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack with one.</p>
      <center>
        <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
        <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
      </center>
      <h4>RITUAL CASTING</h4>
      <p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
      <h4>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h4>
      <p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
    </description>
    <sheet>
			<description>You can cast druid spells as rituals. You can prepare {{druid:spellcasting:prepare}} spells from the druid spell list. You can use a druidic focus as your spellcasting focus.</description>

      <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your bonus action to magically assume the shape of specific animals. There is no limitation to how often you are able to shapeshift into a shape that you know.</p>
      <p class="indent">Your druid level determines the shapes you can trans-form into, as shown in the Shapeshifts table. At 2nd level, for example, you can assume the shape of a large feral cat, or a thick furred bear. Each shapeshift and its benefits are described in Appendix A at the end of this book.</p>

      <p class="indent">You can stay shapeshifted for as long as you wish. You can revert to your normal form by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
      <p class="indent">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your retain your game statistics, alignment, and person-ality. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the shape.</li>
        <li>Shapeshifting does not change your hit points, and any damage taken whilst in a shapeshift carries over to your humanoid form upon reverting back.</li>
        <li>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabil-ities of your shapeshift. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell that you've already cast.</li>
        <li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the shapeshift is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
        <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, or merges into your new form. Merged equipment has no effect until you leave the shape.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>DRUIDIC FORMS</h5>
      <p>Shapeshifts are an extension of the druid. Both as a person, but also as a race, a taurens shape-shift might grow horns similar to his own. An orc or troll might want their forms to have tusks, and a night elf might decorate theirs with signs of elune. Likewise, their beast might be different, one may choose a slim panther, and another a strong lion, or another feline beast.</p>
      <p class="indent">A list of the most common beasts druids have taken for that shape. Choose one of them as your shape, and modify its appearance as you wish to fit your race, or talk to your DM about becoming something not on the list.</p>
